# Customers Data Analysis - SQLite

## Description
This repository contains SQL queries and scripts for analyzing the `customers` table from the Olist dataset. The analysis demonstrates basic to advanced SQL operations in SQLite, including:

- Data exploration (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`)
- Aggregations and grouping (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
- Self-joins (finding relationships within the same table)
- Subqueries for filtered analysis
- Creating views for reusable summaries
- Index creation and query optimization
- Transactions, maintenance, and performance analysis (`ANALYZE`, `VACUUM`, `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`)

The scripts are designed to be run in **VS Code** with a SQLite extension or any SQLite environment.
